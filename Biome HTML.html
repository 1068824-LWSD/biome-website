        <h3>The tundra is cold and treeless, with low-growing vegetation.The growing season in the tundra is very short, usually only about 4 months during summer, when the polar region is tilted toward the Sun and the days are very long. Location: northernmost regions of the Northern Hemisphere in Russia, Canada, Scandinavia, and Alaska.<h3>

        <h3>Boreal forests are made up primarily of coniferous evergreen trees that can tolerate cold winters and short growing seasons. Boreal forests are sometimes called taiga. Evergreen trees appear green year-round because they drop only a fraction of their needles each year. Location: Boreal forests are found between about 50°N and 60°N in Europe, Russia, and North America.</h3>

        <img class="temperate" src="./images/Temperate rainforest 2.png">
        <h3>Temperate rainforests have moderate mean annual temperatures and high precipitation that supports the growth of very large trees. The temperate rainforest is a coastal biome and can be found in relatively narrow areas around the world. Location: west coast of North America from northern California to Alaska, in southern Chile, on the east coast of Australia and in neighboring Tasmania, and on the west coast of New Zealand.</h3>

        <img class="Seasonal" src="./images/temperate seasonal forest 2.png">
        <h3>Temperate seasonal forest biomes have moderate mean annual temperatures and moderate amounts of precipitation that support broadleaf deciduous trees such as beech, maple, oak, and hickory. The warm summer temperatures in temperate seasonal forests favor rapid decomposition. Location: eastern United States, Japan, China, Europe, Chile, and eastern Australia</h3>

        <img class="woodland" src="./images/WoodlandShrubland 2.png">
        <h3>The woodland/shrubland biome is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Plants of this biome are well adapted to both fire and drought. Many plants quickly resprout after a fire, while others produce seeds that open only upon exposure to the intense heat of a fire. Location: coast of southern California (where it is called chaparral), in southern South America (matorral), in southwestern Australia (mallee), in southern Africa (fynbos), and in a large region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea (maquis).</h3>

        <img class="cold" src="./images/Temperate Grassland Cold Desert 2.png">
        <h3>The temperate grassland/cold desert biome has cold, harsh winters and hot, dry, summers that support grasses and nonwoody flowering plants. These plants are generally well adapted to wildfires and frequent grazing by animals. Their deep roots store energy to enable quick regrowth. Location: Great Plains of North America (where they are called prairies), in South America (pampas), and in central Asia and eastern Europe (steppes).</h3>

        <img class="tropical" src="./images/Tropical Rainforest 2.png">
        <h3>Tropical rainforests are warm and wet, with little seasonal temperature variation. These forests are highly productive with several distinctive layers of vegetation. ecause of the warm temperatures and abundant rainfall, productivity is high, and decomposition is extremely rapid. Location: Central and South America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and northeastern Australia.</h3>

        <h3>Tropical seasonal forest and savannas have warm temperatures and distinct wet and dry seasons. Vegetation ranges from dense stands of shrubs and trees to relatively open landscapes dominated by grasses and scattered deciduous trees. Location: much of Central America, on the Atlantic coast of South America, in southern Asia, in northwestern Australia, and in sub-Saharan Africa.</h3>
